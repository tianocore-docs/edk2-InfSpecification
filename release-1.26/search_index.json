See the EDK\n2.0 Module Development Environment Library Specification for some example\nlibrary classes.\nLibrary Instance\nAn implementation of one or more library classes. See the EDK 2.0 Module\nDevelopment Environment Library Specification for a list of sample library\ninstances.\nModule\nA module is either an executable image or a library instance. For a list of\nmodule types supported by this package, see module type.\nModule Type\nAll libraries and components belong to one of the following module types:\nBASE, SEC, PEI_CORE, PEIM, DXE_CORE, DXE_DRIVER,\nDXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER, DXE_SMM_DRIVER, DXE_SAL_DRIVER, UEFI_DRIVER, or\nUEFI_APPLICATION. These definitions provide a framework that is consistent\nwith a similar set of requirements. A module that is of module type BASE,\ndepends only on headers and libraries provided in the MDE, while a module that\nis of module type DXE_DRIVER depends on common DXE components. For a definition\nof the various module types, see module type. The EDK II build system also\npermits modules of type USER_DEFINED. These modules will not be processed by\nthe EDK II Build system.\nPackage\nA package is a container. It can hold a collection of files for any given set\nof modules. Packages may be described as containing zero or more of any of the\nfollowing:\n\nsource modules, containing all source files and descriptions of a module\n\nbinary modules, containing EFI Sections or a Framework File System and a\ndescription file specific to linking and binary editing of features and\nattributes specified in a Platform Configuration Database (PCD,)\n\nmixed modules, with both binary and source modules\n\n\nMultiple modules can be combined into a package, and multiple packages can be\ncombined into a single package.\nPCD\nPlatform Configuration Database.\nPEI\nPre-EFI Initialization Phase.\nPEIM\nAn API named by a GUID.\nPPI\nA PEIM-to-PEIM Interface that is named by a GUID.\nProtocol\nAn API named by a GUID.\nRuntime Services\nInterfaces that provide access to underlying platform-specific hardware that\nmight be useful during OS runtime, such as time and date services.

A firmware interface specification used on Intel(R)\nItanium(R) Processor based systems.\nSEC\nSecurity Phase is the code in the Framework that contains the processor reset\nvector and launches PEI. This phase is separate from PEI because some security\nschemes require ownership of the reset vector.\nSKU\nStock Keeping Unit.\nSMM\nSystem Management Mode. A generic term for the execution mode entered when a\nCPU detects an SMI. The firmware, in response to the interrupt type, will gain\ncontrol in physical mode. For this document, \"SMM\" describes the operational\nregime for IA32 and x64 processors that share the OS-transparent\ncharacteristics.\nUEFI Application\nAn application that follows the UEFI specification. The only difference between\na UEFI application and a UEFI driver is that an application is unloaded from\nmemory when it exits regardless of return status, while a driver that returns a\nsuccessful return status is not unloaded when its entry point exits.\nUEFI Driver\nA driver that follows the UEFI specification.\nUEFI Specification Version 2.5\nCurrent UEFI version.\nUEFI Platform Initialization Distribution Package Specification Version 1.0\nThe current version of this specification includes Errata B.\nUEFI Platform Initialization Specification 1.4\nCurrent version of the UEFI PI specification.\nUnified EFI Forum\nA non-profit collaborative trade organization formed to promote and manage the\nUEFI standard.

This distinction means that the low-order byte of a multi\nbyte data item in memory is at the lowest address, while the high-order byte is\nat the highest address. Processors of the Intel(R) Itanium(R) processor family\nmay be configured for both \"little endian\" and \"big endian\" operation. All\nimplementations designed to conform to this specification will use \"little\nendian\" operation.\nIn some memory layout descriptions, certain fields are marked reserved.\nSoftware must initialize such fields to zero and ignore them when read. On an\nupdate operation, software must preserve any reserved field.\nThe data structures described in this document generally have the following\nformat:\nSummary\nA brief description of the data structure.\nPrototype\nAn EBNF-type declaration for the data structure.\nParameters\nExplanation of some terms used in the prototype.\nExample\nSample data structure using the prototype.\n1.5.2 Pseudo-Code Conventions\nPseudo code is presented to describe algorithms in a more concise form. None of\nthe algorithms in this document are intended to be compiled directly. The code\nis presented at a level corresponding to the surrounding text.\nIn describing variables, a list is an unordered collection of homogeneous\nobjects. A queue is an ordered list of homogeneous objects. Unless otherwise\nnoted, the ordering is assumed to be FIFO.\nPseudo code is presented in a C-like format, using C conventions where\nappropriate. The coding style, particularly the indentation style, is used for\nreadability and does not necessarily comply with an implementation of the UEFI\nSpecification.\n1.5.3 Typographic Conventions\nThis document uses the typographic and illustrative conventions described below:\n\n\n\nTypographic Convention\nTypographic convention description\n\n\n\n\nPlain text\nThe normal text typeface is used for the vast majority of the descriptive text in a specification.\n\n\nPlain text (blue)\nAny plain text that is underlined and in blue indicates an active link to the crossreference. Click on the word to follow the hyperlink.\n\n\nBold\nIn text, a Bold typeface identifies a processor register name. In other instances, a Bold typeface can be used as a running head within a paragraph.\n\n\nItalic\nIn text, an Italic typeface can be used as emphasis to introduce a new term or to indicate a manual or specification name.\n\n\nBOLD Monospace\nComputer code, example code segments, and all prototype code segments use a BOLD Monospace typeface with a dark red color. These code listings normally appear in one or more separate paragraphs, though words or segments can also be embedded in a normal text paragraph.\n\n\nBold Monospace\nWords in a Bold Monospace typeface that is underlined and in blue indicate an active hyper link to the code definition for that function or type definition. Click on the word to follow the hyper link.\n\n\n$(VAR)\nThis symbol VAR defined by the utility or input files.\n\n\nItalic Bold\nIn code or in text, words in Italic Bold indicate placeholder names for variable information that must be supplied (i.e., arguments).\n\n\n\n\nNote: Due to management and file size considerations, only the first\noccurrence of the reference on each page is an active link.

The INF files are used by EDK II utilities that\nparse build meta-data files (INF, DEC, DSC and FDF files) to generate\nAutoGen.c and AutoGen.h and Makefile/GNU makefile files for the EDK II\nbuild infrastructure.\nThe EDK II INF meta-data file describes properties of a module, how it is\ncoded, what it provides, what it depends on, architecture specific items,\nfeatures, etc. regarding the module. INF files generated during a build (that\nallow distribution of binary modules) describe how the module was compiled,\nlinked and what platform configuration database items (PCDs) are exposed.\nBinary distribution of EDK II modules allows original device manufactures\n(ODMs) to distribute proprietary drivers, without distributing source code, for\ninclusion in a firmware image.\nEDK II modules may be located in sub-directories of a package (a collection\nof related objects.) If a module is \"a Library\", creating the module directory\nin the \"Library\" subdirectory of a package is strongly recommended. An\n\"Include\" package subdirectory may also be required. Header files for modules\nthat define a library class must be placed in the Include/Library directory\nusing the Library Class Name for the file name.\nThe Include directory and sub-directories contain header files that define\neither a library class API or pre-defined (\"industry standard\") data elements.\nOne and only one header file defines the library class API. Multiple library\ninstances can \"produce\" the functionality of a library class. The use of\nlibrary class API headers allows for platform integrators to select a library\ninstance that is suitable for their platform. This usage model frees the driver\ndeveloper from coding a module to specific library instances. Libraries are\nreally nothing more than modules with pre-defined APIs.\nEach module may have one or more INF files that can be used by tools to\ngenerate images. Specifically, the EDK Compatibility Package will contain two\nINF files for any module that contains assembly code. Since the ECP can be used\nwith existing EDK tools (which is only supported by Microsoft and Intel Windows\nbased tools,) a separate INF file to support the multiple tool chain capability\nof the EDK II build system must be provided for the modules that contain\nassembly code. The EDK II ECP will use the basename_edk2.inf for the filename\nof the EDK II build system compatible INF files for non-Windows based tool\nchains, and use just the basename.inf for the filename of EDK only INF files\nused by the EDK build system.\n\nNote: Path and Filename elements within the INF are case-sensitive in order\nto support building on UNIX style operating systems.\n\nNote: GUID values are used during runtime to uniquely map the C names of\nPROTOCOLS, PPIS, PCDS and other variable names.\n\nNote: This document uses a backslash \"\\\" to indicate that a line that\ncannot be displayed in this document on a single line. Within the DSC\nspecification, each entry must appear on a single line.\n\nNote: The total path and file name length is limited by the operating\nsystem and third party tools. It is recommended that for EDK II builds that the\nWORKSPACE directory be either a directory under a subst drive in Windows\n(s:/build as an example) or be located in either the /opt directory or in the\nuser's /home/username directory for Linux and OS/X.\n\n"},"2_inf_overview/21_processing_overview.html":{"url":"2_inf_overview/21_processing_overview.html","title":"2.1 Processing Overview","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

However, the intent of a module's\nINF file is to define the source files, libraries, and definitions relevant to\nbuilding the module, creating binary files that are either raw binary files or\nPE32/PE32+/coff format files. The different sections are described in detail in\nthis chapter. In general, the original EDK parsing utilities read each line\nfrom the [Libraries] or [Components] sections of the build description\n(DSC) file, process the INF file on a line to generate a makefile, and then\ncontinued with the next line. EDK II parsing utilities are token based, which\npermits an element to span multiple lines. The EDK II utilities check both EDK\nand EDK II INF files, and, if required, generate C code files based on the\ncontent of the EDK II INF. Refer to the EDK II Build Specification for more\ninformation regarding these autogenerated files.\nOne major difference between EDK and EDK II is support for non-Microsoft\ndevelopment environments. Because modules may be distributed to developers that\nuse these environments, both source code and the meta-data files need to be\nUNIX*/ GCC clean. One little known fact regarding the Microsoft tools and\noperating systems is their ability to process the forward slash \"/\" character\nas a directory separator.\nAll EDK II INF files MUST use this forward slash character for all directory\npaths specified.\n"},"2_inf_overview/22_information_file_general_rules.html":{"url":"2_inf_overview/22_information_file_general_rules.html","title":"2.2 Information File General Rules","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

While the EDK\ncode base and tools treated libraries completely separate from modules, the EDK\nII code base and tools process modules, with libraries being considered a\nmodule that produces a library class.\n2.2.1 Section Entries\nTo simplify parsing, the EDK II meta-data files continue using the INI format.\nThis style was introduced for EDK meta-data files, when only the Windows tool\nchains were supported. It was decided that for compatibility purposes, that INI\nformat would continue to be used. EDK II formats differ from the defacto format\nin that the semicolon \";\" character cannot be used to indicate a comment.\nLeading and trailing space/tab characters must be ignored.\nDuplicate section names must be merged by tools.\nThis description file consists of sections delineated by section tags enclosed\nwithin square [] brackets. Section tag entries are case-insensitive. The\ndifferent sections and their usage are described below. The text of a given\nsection can be used for multiple section names by separating the section names\nwith a comma. For example:\n[Sources.X64, Sources.IPF]\nThe content below each section heading is processed by the parsing utilities in\nthe order that they occur in the file. The precedence for processing these\narchitecture section tags is from right to left, with sections defining an\narchitecture having a higher precedence than a section which uses common (or no\narchitecture extension) as the architecture.\n\nNote: Content within a section IS case sensitive. IA32, Ia32 and ia32\nwithin a section are processed as separate items. (Refer to Naming Conventions\nbelow for more information on directory and/or file naming.)\n\nSections are terminated by the start of another section or the end of the file.\nDuplicate sections (two sections with identical section tags) will be merged by\ntools, with the second section appended to the first.\nIf architectural modifiers are used in the section tag, the section is merged\nby tools with content from common sections (if specified) with the\narchitectural section appended to the first, into an architectural section. For\nexample, given the following:\n[Sources]\n  ACommonFile.c\n\n[Sources.IA32]\n  BforIa32.c\n\n[Sources.X64]\n  CforX64.c\n\nAfter the first pass of the tools, when building the module for IA32, the\nsource files will logically be:\n[Sources.IA32]\n  ACommonFile.c\n  BforIa32.c\n\nWhen building the module for X64, the source files will logically be:\n[Sources.X64]\n  ACommonFile.c\n  CforX64.c\n\nThe [Defines] section tag prohibits use of architectural modifiers. All other\nsections can specify architectural modifiers.\n2.2.2 Comments\nThe hash # character indicates comments in the Module Information (INF) file.\nIn line comments terminate the processing of a line. In line comments must be\nplaced at the end of the line, and may not be placed within the section\n([,]) tags.\nOnly gPkgTSGuid.PcdFoo|TRUE|BOOLEAN|0x00000015 in the following example is\nprocessed by tools; the remainder of the line is ignored:\ngPkgTSGuid.PcdFoo|TRUE|BOOLEAN|0x00000015 # EFI_FOO_MEMORY\n\nNote: Blank lines and lines that start with the hash # character must be\nignored by build tools.\n\nHash characters appearing within a quoted string are permitted, with the string\nbeing processed as a single entity. The following example must handle the\nquoted string as single element by tools.\nUI = \"# Copyright 2007, No Such, LTD. All rights reserved.\"\nComments are terminated by the end of line.\n2.2.3 Valid Entries\nProcessing of the line is terminated if a comment is encountered.\nProcessing of a line is terminated by the end of the line.\nItems in quotation marks are treated as a single token and have the highest\nprecedence. All expressions must be written using in-fix notation (operators\nare written between the operands). Parenthesis surrounding groups of operands\nand operators must be used to determine the order in which operations are to be\nperformed. All other processing occurs from left to right.\nIn the following example, B - C is processed first, then result is added to A\nfollowed by adding 2; finally 3 is added to the result.\n(A + (B - C) + 2) + 3\nIn the next example, A + B is processed first, then C + D is processed and\nfinally the two results are added.\n(A + B) + (C + D)\nSpace and tab characters are permitted around field separators.\n2.2.4 Naming Conventions\nThe EDK II build infrastructure is supported under Microsoft Windows, Linux*\nand MAC OS/X operating systems. All directory and file names must be treated as\ncase sensitive because of multiple environment support.\n\nThe use of special characters in directory names and file names is restricted\nto the dash, underscore, and period characters, respectively \"-\", \"_\", and\n\".\".\n\nPeriod characters must not be followed by another period character. File and\nDirectory names must not start with \"./\", \".\" or \"..\".\n\nSpace characters must never be used in the directory path specified by the\nsystem environment variable, WORKSPACE.\n\nDirectory names and file names within the WORKSPACE directory tree must not\ncontain space characters.\n\nDirectory Names must only contain alphanumeric, dash, underscore and period\ncharacters (two sequential period characters, \"..\" are not permitted); it is\nrecommended that the name start with an alpha character.\n\nAll files (except those listed in the Packages sections) must reside in the\ndirectory containing the INF file or in sub-directories of the directory\ncontaining the INF file.\n\nAdditionally, all EDK II directories that are architecturally dependent must\nuse a name with only the first character capitalized. Ia32, Ipf, X64 and Ebc\nare valid architectural directory names. IA32, IPF and EBC are not acceptable\ndirectory names, and may cause build breaks. From a build tools perspective,\nIA32 is not equivalent to Ia32 or ia32.\n\nAbsolute paths are not permitted in EDK II INF files. All paths specified are\nrelative to an EDK II package directory (defined as a directory containing a\nDEC file) or relative to the directory containing the INF file.\n\n\nThe build tools must be able to process the tool definitions file:\ntools_def.txt (describing the location and flags for compiler and user\ndefined tools), which may contain space characters in paths on Windows* systems.\n\nNote: The toolsdef.txt file and [BuildOptions] sections are the\nplaces that permit the use of space characters in a directory path.\n\nThe EDK II Coding Style specification covers naming conventions for use within\nC Code files, and as well as specifying the rules for directory and file names.\nThis section is meant to highlight those rules as they apply to the content of\nthe INF files.\nArchitecture keywords (IA32, IPF, X64 and EBC) are used by build tools\nand in metadata files for describing alternate threads for processing of files.\nThese keywords must not be used for describing directory paths. Additionally,\ndirectory names with architectural names (Ia32, Ipf, X64 and Ebc) do not\nautomatically cause the build tools or meta-data files to follow these\nalternate paths. Directories and Architectural Keywords are similar in name\nonly.\nAll directory paths within EDK II INF files must use the forward slash \"/\"\ncharacter to separate directories as well as directories from filenames.\nExample:\nC:/Work/Edk2/edksetup.bat\nFile names must also follow the same naming convention required for\ndirectories. No space characters are permitted. The special characters\npermitted in directory names are the only special characters permitted in file\nnames.\n2.2.5 !include Statements\nThe !include statement are NOT permitted in the INF files.\n2.2.6 Macro Statements\nUse of MACRO statements in the EDK II INF files is limited to local usage only;\nglobal or external macros are not permitted. This decision was made in order to\nsupport UEFI's PI Distribution Package Specification requirements.\nMacro statements are permitted in the EDK II INF files. Macro statements assign\na Value to a Variable Name, and are only valid during the processing of the INF\nspecifying the value. If a value is not specified, then the MACRO has a value\nof zero.\nToken names (reserved words defined in the EDK II meta-data file\nspecifications) cannot be used as macro names. As an example, using\nPLATFORM_NAME as a macro name is not permitted, as it is a token defined in the\nDSC file's [Defines] section.\nAny defined MACRO definitions will be expanded by tools when they encounter the\nentry in the section except when the macro is within double quotation marks in\nbuild options sections. The expectation is that these macros will be expanded\nby scripting tools such as make or nmake.\nMacros can be used to define a path, a filename, any combination of path and\nfile names or content that will appear in the right side of a statement in the\n[BuildOptions] section. Macros for paths and files can be defined and used in\n[Defines], [LibraryClasses], [Sources], [Binaries], and [Packages]\nsections.\nMacro Definition statements that appear within a section of the file (other\nthan the [Defines] section) are scoped to the section they are defined in. If\nthe Macro statement is within the [Defines] section, then the Macro is common\nto the entire file, with local definitions taking precedence (if the same MACRO\nname is redefined in subsequent sections, then the MACRO value is local to only\nthat section.)\nIn the following example, the MACRO, IFMP is used to fit a long\ndirectory/filename pair on to a single line.:\nDEFINE IFMP = IntelFrameworkModulePackage\nUsing the macro, for example, in a [Packages] section, looks like:\n$(IFMP)/IntelFrameworkModulePackage.dec\nMacros are evaluated where they are used in statements, not where they are\ndefined. It is recommended that tools break the build and report an error if an\nexpression cannot be evaluated.\nMacros used in build flags (in [BuildOptions] sections) that are encapsulated\nby quotation marks are not expanded by tools, and do not need to be local to\nthe INF file. The expectation is that macros in the quoted values will be\nexpanded by external build scripting tools, such as nmake or gmake; they\nwill not be expanded by the build tools.\nThe macro statements are positional, in that only statements following a macro\ndefinition are permitted to use the macro - a macro cannot be used before it\nhas been defined.\nMacros defined in common sections may be used in the architecturally modified\nsections of the same section type. Macros defined in architectural sections\ncannot be used in other architectural sections, nor can they be used in the\ncommon section. Section modifiers in addition to the architectural modifier\nfollow the same rules as architectural modifiers.\nWithin the EDK II INF File, macros are expanded (except within quotes), not\nevaluated, during the parsing of the file.\nExample\n[LibraryClasses.common]\n  DEFINE MDE = MdePkg/Library\n  BaseLib|$(MDE)/BaseLib.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.X64, LibraryClasses.IA32]\n  # Can use $(MDE), cannot use $(MDEMEM)\n  DEFINE PERF = PerformancePkg/Library\n  TimerLib|$(PERF)/DxeTscTimerLib/DxeTscTimerLib.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.X64.PEIM]\n  # Can use $(MDE) and $(PERF)\n  DEFINE MDEMEM = $(MDE)/PeiMemoryAllocationLib\n  MemoryAllocationLib|$(MDEMEM)/PeiMemoryAllocationLib.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.IPF]\n  # Cannot use $(PERF) or $(MDEMEM)\n  # Can use $(MDE) from the common section\n  PalLib|$(MDE)/UefiPalLib/UefiPalLib.inf\n  TimerLib|$(MDE)/BaseTimerLibNullTemplate/BaseTimerLibNullTemplate.inf\n\nIn the previous example, the directory and filename for a library instance is\nthe recommended instance and may not be the actual library linked to the\nmodule, as the platform integrator may choose a different library instance to\nsatisfy a library class dependency.\n2.2.7 Conditional Directive Statements (!if...)\nConditional statements are NOT permitted in the EDK II INF files.\n2.2.8 Expressions\nExpressions are supported in specific statements within the EDK II INF files.\nThe expression syntax is defined in the EDK II Expression Syntax\nSpecification.\n"},"2_inf_overview/23_edk_ii_inf_format.html":{"url":"2_inf_overview/23_edk_ii_inf_format.html","title":"2.3 EDK II INF Format","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The INF_VERSION of existing\nINF files does not need to be updated unless content in the file has been\nupdated to match new content specified by this revision of the specification.\nArchitectural modifiers are not permitted in the [Defines] section.\nThe parsing utilities process any local symbol assignments defined in this\nsection. The\nEDK II parsing utilities will use some of this section's information for\ngenerating AutoGen.c and AutoGen.h files. Note that the sections are\nprocessed in the order listed in the INF file, and later assignments of these\nlocal symbols override previous assignments.\n[Defines]\nThe format for entries in this section is:\nName = Value\nThe following is an example of a driver's [Defines] section.\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION     = 0x00010019\n  BASE_NAME       = DxeIpl\n  FILE_GUID       = 86D70125-BAA3-4296-A62F-602BEBBB9081\n  VERSION_STRING  = 1.0\n  MODULE_TYPE     = PEIM\n  ENTRY_POINT     = PeimInitializeDxeIpl\n  MODULE_UNI_FILE = DxeIpl.uni\n\nThe following is an example of a library's [Defines] section.\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION    = 1.25\n  BASE_NAME      = BaseMemoryLib\n  FILE_GUID      = fd44e603-002a-4b29-9f5f-529e815b6165\n  MODULE_TYPE    = BASE\n  VERSION_STRING = 1.0\n  LIBRARY_CLASS  = BaseMemoryLib\n\nDrivers may expose library functionality, such as a DXE_CORE module that may\nimplement functions that satisfy the BaseMemoryAllocation library class. In\nthis instance, the driver module would also specify the LIBRARY_CLASS in the\n[Defines] section. Other DXE drivers that would require a library instance for\nthe BaseMemoryAllocation class could specify the DXE_CORE INF file as the\nrecommended instance for satisfying the required library class instance.\nAppendix G lists the available MODULE_TYPE values supported by EDK II INF\nfiles.\nThe EDK II [Defines] section is common to all architectures and does not\npermit using architectural modifiers in the section tag name.\nThe following table shows EDK II unique elements of a defines section that\nmay be required for generating the AutoGen.c and AutoGen.h files.

If a revision value is not declared in the module or any of the dependent libraries, then tools may use the value of 0, which disables checking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION must only be set in the INF file if the module depends on services or system table fields or PI core behaviors that are not present in the PI 1.0 version. For example, if a module depends on definitions in PI 1.1 that are not in PI 1.0, then PI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION must be 0x0001000A\n\n\nUEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION\nNot required\nDecimal or special format of hex\nThe minimum revision value across the module and all its dependent libraries. If a revision value is not declared in the module or any of the dependent libraries, then tools may use the value of 0, which disables checking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSIon must only be set in the INF file if the module depends on UEFI Boot Services or UEFI Runtime Services or UEFI System Table fields or UEFI core behaviors that are not present in the UEFI 2.1 version. For example, if a module depends on definitions in UEFI 2.2 that are not in UEFI 2.1, then UEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION must be 0x00020014\n\n\nFILE_GUID\nREQUIRED\nGUID Value\nRegistry (8-4-4-4-12) Format This value is required for all EDK II format INF files, required for EDK driver INF files, not required for EDK libraries\n\n\nMODULE_TYPE\nREQUIRED\n\nThis is the type of module. One of the EDK II Module Types. For Library Modules, the MODULE_TYPE must specify the MODULE_TYPE of the module that will use the driver.\n\n\nBUILD_NUMBER\nOptional\nUINT16 Value\nThis optional element, if present (or set in the DSC file), is used during the creation of the EFI_VERSION_SECTION for this module; if it is not present, then the BuildNumber field of the EFI_VERSION_SECTION will be set to 0.\n\n\nVERSION_STRING\nREQUIRED\nString\nIf present, this value will be encoded as USC-2 characters in a Unicode file for the VERSION section of the FFS unless a ver or ver_ui file has been specified in the [Binaries] section.\n\n\nMODULE_UNI_FILE\nOptional\nFilename\nA Unicode file containing UCS-2 character localization strings; the file path (if present) is relative to the directory containing the INF file. The use of #include statements in this file is prohibited.\n\n\nLIBRARY_CLASS\nTypically not specified for a Driver; REQUIRED for a Library Only Module\nWord | List [\"|\" Word | List]*\nOne Library Class that is satisfied by this Library Instance; one or more LIBRARY_CLASS lines may be specified by a module. The reserved keyword, NULL, must be listed for library class instances that do NOT support a library class keyword.\n\n\nPCD_IS_DRIVER\nNot required - Driver Only\nPEI_PCD_DRIVER or DXE_PCD_DRIVER\nOnly required for the two (PEI_PCD_DRIVER or DXE_PCD_DRIVER) PCD Driver modules.\n\n\nENTRY_POINT\nNot required - Driver Only\nCName\nThis is the name of the driver's entry point function.\n\n\nUNLOAD_IMAGE\nNot required - Driver Only\nCName\nIf a driver chooses to be unloadable, then this is the name of the module's function registered in the Loaded Image Protocol. It is called if the UEFI Boot Service UnloadImage() is called for the module, which then executes the Unload function, disconnecting itself from handles in the database as well as uninstalling any protocols that were installed in the driver entry point. The CName is the name of this module's unload function.\n\n\nCONSTRUCTOR\nNot required - Library Only\nCName\nThis only applies to components that are libraries. It is required for EDK II libraries if the module's INF contains a Constructor element. This value is used to call the specified function before calling into the library itself.\n\n\nDESTRUCTOR\nNot required - Library Only\nCName\nThis only applies to components that are libraries. This value is used to call the specified function before calling into the library itself.\n\n\nSHADOW\nNot required - SEC, PEIM and PEI_CORE Driver modules only\nTRUE | FALSE\nThis boolean operator is used by SEC, PEI_CORE and PEIM modules to indicate if the module was coded to use REGISTER_FOR_SHADOW. If the value is TRUE, the .reloc section of the PE32 image is not removed, otherwise, the .reloc section is stripped to conserve space in the final binary images. The default value is FALSE.\n\n\nPCI_DEVICE_ID\nNot required - Required for UEFI PCI Option ROMs\nHex Number\nThe PCI Device Id for this device.\n\n\nPCI_VENDOR_ID\nNot required - Required for UEFI PCI Option ROMs\nHex Number\nThe PCI Vendor Id for this device\n\n\nPCI_CLASS_CODE\nNot required - Required for UEFI PCI Option ROMs\nHex Number\nThe PCI Class Code for this device\n\n\nPCI_COMPRESS\nNot required UEFI PCI Option ROMs\nTRUE | FALSE\nThis flag is used by tools to compress a PCI Option ROM image file, the default (if not specified) is FALSE\n\n\nUEFI_HII_RESOURCE_SECTION\nNot required Driver Only\nTRUE | FALSE\nThis boolean operator is used to indicate that the module will require a separate HII resource section in the efi image file.\n\n\nDEFINE\nNot required\nName = Value\nThe value must be a directory name, and the name can be used with $( and ) character sets. This allows shortening of lines typed by users.\n\n\nSPEC\nNot required\nCName = Value\nA User-specified #define CName Value pair that will be included in the AutoGen.h file.\n\n\nCUSTOM_MAKEFILE\nNot required\nFamily | File\nA user written makefile that will be used, the INF file will not be parsed.  The Family is one of MSFT or GCC followed by a field separator \"|\" character, then the filename of the makefile in the same directory as the INF file. To keep GCC compatibility, the user must generate two Makefiles, one for MSFT, such as makefile and another for GCC, such as GNUmakefile\n\n\nDPX_SOURCE\nNot Required Driver Only\nFilename\nIf present, the file must contain all DEPEX statements (as defined in the UEFI PI specification), as the tools will process the file, ignoring any content in [Depex] sections in this file AND all inherited dependencies from libraries. This allows the module owner to force a Depex independently. Use of this option is not recommended for normal use.\n\n\n\n"},"2_inf_overview/25_[sources]_section.html":{"url":"2_inf_overview/25_[sources]_section.html","title":"2.5 [Sources] Section","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The binary files listed are not used by\nthe $(MAKE) portion of a platform build, but are used by other tools to\ngenerate an image suitable for either an Application, FD or FV. A pipe\ncharacter \"|\" is used to separate the fields. If the file is in a\nsub-directory, then the relative (to the INF file) path must be included as\npart of the file name.

The entries for these sections are looked up from the package\ndeclaration files (DEC) for generating the AutoGen.c and AutoGen.h files.\nThe PCD's Name (PcdName) is defined as PCD Token Space GUID C name and the\nPCD C name - separated by a period \".\" character. Unique PCDs are identified\nusing the following format to identify the named PCD:\nPcdTokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdCName\nPCDs listed in architectural sections must not be listed in common\narchitectural sections. It is not possible for a PCD to be valid for only IA32\nand also valid for any architecture.\nA PCD may be valid for IA32 and X64 and invalid for EBC and IPF usage, so\nmixing of specific architectural modifiers is permitted.\nThis section defines how a module has been coded to access a PCD. A PCD can\nonly be accessed using the function defined by the UEFI specification for a\nsingle type, therefore, mixing PCD section types is not permitted.\nThere are five defined PCD types. Do not confuse these types with the data\ntypes of the PCDs. The five types are: FeaturePcd (in code, identified as\nFEATURE_FLAG), FixedPcd(FIXED_AT_BUILD), PatchPcd(PATCHABLE_IN_MODULE)\nand two dynamic types of PCDs, Pcd(DYNAMIC) and PcdEx(DYNAMIC_EX).\nThe two recommended types that are commonly used in modules are: Feature PCD\nand the dynamic PCD form. The PCD is used for configuration when the PCD value\nis produced and consumed by drivers during execution, the value may be user\nconfigurable from setup or the value is produced by the platform in a specified\narea. It is associated with modules that are released in source code. The\ndynamic form is the most flexible method, as platform integrators may chose a\nto use a different type (such as fixed) for a given platform without modifying\nthe module's INF file or the code for the module. For modules that will be\ndistributed as binaries, the PatchPcd and PcdEx are the only supported\ntypes.\nThe FeaturePcd is used to enable some code paths; the EDK II build system\nwill generate a const statement for these PCDs.\nSimilar in function, the dynamic PcdEx type can be used with modules that are\nreleased as binary. However, the access methods for this style prevents using\nthese PCDs as any other PCD type (source code must change in order for a\nPcdEx to be used as a FixedPcd).\nThe FixedPcd and PatchPcd are static and only the PatchPcd can have the\nvalue changed in a binary prior to including the module in a firmware image.\nThe content of this section is the PCD Token Space Guid C Name, followed by a\nperiod \".\" character and then the C name of the PCD. The default value is\noptional. (See chapter 3, Module Information (INF) Format Specification,\nlater in this document for definition of the content.) Every PCD (PcdName) is\nidentified by two parts, the PCD's Token Space Guid C Name and the PCD's C Name.\nThese two items are separated by a period \".\" character. This section uses\none of the following section definitions:\n[(PcdType)]\n[(PcdType).common]\n[(PcdType).IA32]\n[(PcdType).X64]\n[(PcdType).IPF]\n[(PcdType).EBC]\n\nThe required entries for this section are the PCD Token Space Guid C Name's for\nthe PCD that will be looked up by tools from the DEC files, and the PCD's C\nname - that must be specified in the DEC files to limit accidental duplicate\nPCD C Name collisions. A default value that the module developer suggests to\nuse for the PCD is optional.\nTokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdCName\nValues of PCDs defined in this file override the default values specified in\nthe EDK II package declaration (DEC) file. The platform integrator can specify\nvalues in the DSC and FDF files or on the build command line to override any\nsettings in this file. If a default value is not specified, the build system\nuses 1) values from the command line, 2) values from the FDF file, 3) values\nfrom the DSC file or 4) values from the DEC file.\nExpressions, or Feature Flag Expressions, may be used on PCD entry lines.\nIf there are files listed in a [Binaries] section and this is a PatchPcd\nsection, and the third field of an entry is a Hex number, 0x00000012, then\nthe value is an offset into a binary image. The format for this type of\nentry is:\nPcdName | Value | HexValue\nFor all other instances, the format for this type of entry is:\nPcdName | [Value] [ | FeatureFlagExpression]\nWhen a FeatureFlagExpression is present, if the expression evaluates to\nTRUE, then the PCD entry is valid. If the expression evaluates to FALSE,\nthen the EDK II build tools must ignore the entry.\n2.14.1 FIXED_AT_BUILD\nThe content for the PCD entry is the PCD's Name (PCD's Token Space Guid C name,\nfollowed by a period \".\" character then the PCD's C name) and an optional\nDefault value.

If\na PEI, SMM or DXE DEPEX section is required, the user must specify a\nModuleType of PEIM to generate a PEI_DEPEX section, a ModuleType of\nDXE_DRIVER to generate a DXE_DEPEX section, or a ModuleType of\nDXE_SMM_DRIVER to generate an SMM_DEPEX section.\n\nIf the ModuleType is SEC, UEFI_APPLICATION, UEFI_DRIVER, PEI_CORE,\nSMM_CORE or DXE_CORE, no [Depex] sections are permitted and all library\nclass [Depex] sections are ignored.\n\nModule types PEIM, DXE_DRIVER, DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER, DXE_SAL_DRIVER and\nDXE_SMM_DRIVER require a [Depex] section unless the dependencies are\nspecified by a PEI_DEPEX, DXE_DEPEX or SMM_DEPEX in the [Binaries]\nsection.\n\n\nThe Depex section headers start with one of the following:\n[Depex]\n[Depex.IA32]\n[Depex.X64]\n[Depex.IPF]\n[Depex.EBC]\n[Depex.common]\n\nWhen generating the \"As Built\" binary INF during a build, the complete\ndependency expression, including dependencies from library instances, will be\nlisted in comments.\nThe following are examples of Depex section:\n[Depex]\n  TRUE\n\n[Depex.IA32.DXE_DRIVER, Depex.IA32.DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER]\n  gEfiPcdProtocolGuid\n\n"},"2_inf_overview/216_[userextensions]_section.html":{"url":"2_inf_overview/216_[userextensions]_section.html","title":"2.16 [UserExtensions] Section","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Additionally, names that\nare C variables or used as a macro are case sensitive. Other elements such as\nsection tags or hex digits, in the INF file are not case-sensitive. The use of\n\"..\", \"../\" and \"./\" in paths and filenames is strictly prohibited.\n\nNote: This document uses a backslash \"\\\" character to indicate that a line\nthat cannot be displayed in this document on a single line. Within the INF\nspecification, each entry must appear on a single line.\n\n\nMultiple INF files may exist in a directory, however either the FILE_GUID\nor the VERSION_STRING must be unique to the INF file. It is recommended\nthat the BASE_NAME also be unique (and match the INF filename, as in\nBaseLib.inf will use a BASE_NAME of BaseLib).\n\nText in section tags (text between square brackets) is not case sensitive.\n\nA section terminates with either another section definition or the end of the\nfile.\n\nTo append comment information to any item, the comment must start with a hash\n\"#\" character.\n\nAll comments terminate with the end of line character.\n\nAny comment not associated with a defined comment format is considered a\nglobal comment.\n\nGlobal comments must be separated from formatted comments by a blank line.\n\nField separators for lines that contain more than one field is the pipe \"|\"\ncharacter. This character was selected to reduce the possibility of having\nthe field separator character appear in a string, such as a filename or text\nstring.\n\n\n\nNote: The only notable exception is the PcdName which is a combination of\nthe PcdTokenSpaceGuidCName and the PcdCName that are separated by the period \".\"\ncharacter. This notation for a PCD name was used to uniquely identify the PCD.\n\n\nA line terminates with either an end of line character or a comment.\n\nExcept for binary \"As Built\" INF files generated by the tools, when\nprocessing numeric values, either integer or hex, leading zeros specified in\nthe entry may be ignored. For example, 0x00000000000000000000001 can be a\nvalid value for a UINT8 data type, as the actual value is 1 The generated\nbinary \"As Built\" INF file must use zero byte filled in order to specify a\nthe length of a VOID* PCD value.\n\nSections with duplicate tags, such as two section tags: [BuildOptions],\nwill be combined by tools, with the second section's content appended to the\nsection content that was first in the file.\n\nSections with architectural modifiers are appended by tools to section\ncontent with either the \"common\" or no architectural modifiers if it\nexists. The combined result is then considered a complete section.\n\n\n3.1.1 Backslash\nThe backslash \"\\\" character in this document is only for lines that cannot be\ndisplayed within the margins of this document. The backslash character must not\nbe used to extend a line over multiple lines in the INF file.\n3.1.2 Whitespace characters\nWhitespace (space and tab) characters are permitted between token and field\nseparator elements for all entries.\nWhitespace characters are not permitted between the PcdTokenSpaceGuidCName and\nthe dot, nor are they permitted between the dot and the PcdCName.\n3.1.3 Paths for File Names\nNote that for specifying the path for a file name, if the path value starts\nwith a dollar \"$\" sign character a local MACRO variable is being specified.\nWhite space characters are not permitted in path names.\n\nNote: The use of \"..\", \"./\" and \"../\" in a path element is prohibited.\n\nFor all EDK II INF files, the directory path must use the forward slash\ncharacter for separating directories. (For example, MdePkg/Include/ should be\nspecified).\nUnless otherwise noted, all file names and paths must be relative to the\ndirectory where the INF file is located.\n"},"3_edk_ii_inf_file_format/32_component_inf_definition.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_inf_file_format/32_component_inf_definition.html","title":"3.2 Component INF Definition","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The platform integrator will can\nselect library instances that will be used for a given library class, providing\ngreater flexibility to the module developer. It is not possible to code a\nmodule to a specific implementation of a library instance. It is only possible\nto code a module to use a library class. The [Defines] section must appear\nbefore any other section except the header. (The header, when specified, is\nalways the first section of an INF file.)

The\nbuild tools parser must treat all content between the field separators\n(excluding white space characters around the field separators) as ASCII literal\ncontent when generating the AutoGen.c and AutoGen.h files.\nComments\nStrings that appear in comments may be ignored by the build tools. An ASCII\nstring matching the format of the ASCII string defined by \n(L\"Foo\" for example,) that appears in a comment must never be expanded by any\ntool.\nCFlags\nCFlags refers to a string of valid arguments appended to the command line of\nany third party or provided tool. It is not limited to just a compiler\nexecutable tool. MACRO values that appear in quoted strings in CFlags content\nmust not be expanded by parsing tools.\nOA\nOther Architecture - One or more user defined target architectures, such as ARM\nor PPC. The architectures listed here must have a corresponding entry in the\nEDK II meta-data file, Conf/tools_def.txt. Only IA32, X64, IPF and EBC are\nroutinely validated.\nExtendedLine\nThe use of the Extended Line format is prohibited.\nFileSep\nFileSep refers to either the backslash \"\\\" or forward slash \"/\" characters that\nare used to separate directory names. All EDK II INF files must use the \"/\"\nforward slash character when specifying the directory portion of a filename.\nMicrosoft operating systems, that normally use a backslash character for\nseparating directory names, will interpret the forward slash character\ncorrectly. Use of \"..\", \".\" and \"../\" in the directory path is not permitted.\nUse of an absolute path is not permitted.\nCArray\nAll C data arrays used in PCD value fields must be byte arrays. The C format\nGUID style is a special case that is permitted in some fields that use the\n nomenclature.\nEnd of Line Characters\nThe DOS End Of Line: \"0x0D 0x0A\" character must be used for all EDK II\nmetadata files. All Nix based tools can properly process the DOS EOL\ncharacters. Microsoft based tools cannot process the Nix style EOL characters.\n3.2.2 MACRO Statements\nUse of MACRO statements is optional.\nSummary\nMacro statements are characterize by a DEFINE line. Macro statements in INF\nfiles are only permitted to describe a path (shortcut name,) or used to provide\na shorter text string in C Flags in the [BuildOptions] section. If the Macro\nstatement is within the [Defines] section, then the Macro is common to the\nentire file, with local definitions taking precedence (if the same MACRO name\nis used in subsequent sections, then the MACRO value is local to only that\nsection.)\nMacro statements in comments must be ignored by parsing tools.\nMacro statements that are referenced before they are defined will have a value\nof zero. A macro defined in a section that is common to all architectures is\nalso value for sections that have architectural modifiers.\nIt is recommended that if the tools encounter a macroval, as in $(MACRO), that\nis not defined, the build tools must break.\nPrototype\n ::=  \"DEFINE\"    [] \n           ::= {} {} {}\n\nParameters\nPath Definitions\nWhitespace characters are not permitted in path statements. While some\noperating systems permit using space characters or special characters within a\npath element, the EDK II build system will not support whitespace characters\nand will only permit alphanumeric characters, and the dot, dash, underline,\nforward and back slash characters in file names. Use of \"..\", \".\" and \"../\" in\nthe directory path is not permitted. Use of an absolute path is not permitted.\nIt is also permitted, although not specified in the EBNF for  to end\nhave the path end with the file separator character, as in MdePkg/.\nExamples:\nDEFINE TEST          = test\nDEFINE TEST1         = test/\nDEFINE TEST2         = MyFile.c\nDEFINE TEST3         = $(TEST1)$(TEST2)\nDEFINE TEST4         = $(TEST)/$(TEST2)\nDEFINE GEN_SKU       = MyPlatformPkg/GenPei\nDEFINE SKU1          = MyPlatformPkg/Sku1/Pei\nDEFINE OPENSSL_FLAGS = -DOPENSSL_SYSNAME_UWIN -DOPENSSL_SYS_UEFI\n\nTable 4 Macro Usages\n\n\n\nMACRO DEFINITION\nMACRO USAGE\n\n\n\n\nDEFINE MY_MACRO = test1\n$(MY_MACRO)/test2/test3.inf\n\n\nDEFINE MY_MACRO = test1/\n$(MY_MACRO)test2/test3.inf\n\n\nDEFINE MY_MACRO = test3.inf\ntest1/test2/$(MY_MACRO)\n\n\nDEFINE MY_MACRO = test3\ntest1/test2/$(MY_MACRO).inf\n\n\nDEFINE MY_MACRO = test1/test2/test3.inf\n$(MY_MACRO)\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Conditional Statements\nThe conditional statements are not permitted anywhere within the INF file.\n3.2.4 !include Statement\nThe !include statement is not permitted in an EDK II INF file.\n3.2.5 Special Comment Blocks\nThis section defines special format comment blocks that contain information\nabout this module. These comment blocks are not required. They may appear at\nthe end of any section within the INF file, however it is preferred that they\nappear at the end of the file. The format of these comment blocks is the\nrecommended format that will guarantee that the information is correctly\ninserted into UEFI Distribution Package description files. If this comment\nblock appears in a \"Source\" INF file, the EDK II build tools must copy this\ncomment block into the generated \"As Built\" binary INF file.\nThese comment blocks are only required for modules that use C calls to perform\nactions using UEFI defined functions listed in below.\nThere are three predefined types of comments.\nThe Event types which describe timer delays used by the Boot Services\nSetTimer() call.\n\nEVENT_TYPE_PERIODIC_TIMER - Event is to be signaled periodically.\nEVENT_TYPE_RELATIVE_TIMER - Event is to be signaled in x 100ns units.\nUNDEFINED - This will appear when a UEFI Distribution Package tool was\nunable to parse the comment (spelling error) when creating a distribution\npackage, and the tool installed the distribution package using this value.\n\nThe BootMode types which describe the BootMode values in the Boot Services\nSetBootMode() and GetBootMode() calls.\n\nFULL - Equivalent to BOOT_WITH_FULL_CONFIGURATION\nMINIMAL - Equivalent to BOOT_WITH_MINIMAL_CONFIGURATION\nNO_CHANGE - Equivalent to BOOT_ASSUMING_NO_CONFIGURATION_CHANGES\nDIAGNOSTICS - Equivalent to BOOT_WITH_FULL_CONFIGURATION\nDEFAULT - Equivalent to BOOT_WITH_FULL_CONFIGURATION\nS2_RESUME - Equivalent to BOOT_ON_S2_RESUME\nS3_RESUME - Equivalent to BOOT_ON_S3_RESUME\nS4_RESUME - Equivalent to BOOT_ON_S4_RESUME\nS5_RESUME - Equivalent to BOOT_ON_S5_RESUME\nFLASH_UPDATE - Equivalent to BOOT_ON_FLASH_UPDATE\nRECOVERY_FULL - Equivalent to BOOT_IN_RECOVERY_MODE\nBOOT_MFG_MODE - Equivalent to BOOT_WITH_MFG_MODE_SETTINGS\nUNDEFINED - This will appear when a UEFI Distribution Package tool was\nunable to parse the comment (spelling error) when creating a distribution\npackage and the tool installed the distribution package using this value.\n\nThe following items are defined as special boots that may use the bit field\nvalues: 100001b - 111111b per the PI PEI specification, table 6 Since this\ncomment block is informational, no attempt is made to map these items to\nspecific bit patterns.\n\nRECOVERY_MINIMAL\nRECOVERY_NO_CHANGE\nRECOVERY_DIAGNOSTICS\nRECOVERY_DEFAULT\nRECOVERY_S2_RESUME\nRECOVERY_S3_RESUME\nRECOVERY_S4_RESUME\nRECOVERY_S5_RESUME\nRECOVERY_FLASH_UPDATE\n\nThe Hand-Off Block types refer to the various HOBs as defined by the PI\nspecification, HOB Code Definitions.

This\nfile is created during installation of a UEFI distribution package or by the\ndeveloper and is an input to the new build tool parsing utilities. Elements may\nappear in any order within this section.\nThe version for this specification is \"0x00010019\" and new versions of this\nspecification must increment the minor (0019) portion of the specification code\nfor backward compatible changes, and increment the major number for\nnon-backward compatible specification changes. This value may also be specified\nas a decimal value, 1.25.\nThe [Defines] section assigns values to the symbols that describe the\ncomponent. Some items are emitted to the output makefile, others are used to\ncreate filenames during the build. Some symbols are emitted to the generated C\nfiles.\nThe FILE_GUID is required for all EDK II modules. This GUID is used to build\nthe FW volume file list used by build tools to generate the final firmware\nvolume, as well as processed in some SMM, PEI or DXE DEPEX statements.\nAll new EDK II INF files must include one of the following statements:\nINF_VERSION = 0x00010019 or INF_VERSION = 1.25 in this section, where the\nnumber varies according to the release of this specification. It is a\nHexVersion type, where the 0x0001 is the major number, and the 0019 is the\nminor number. This version of the specification provides full backward\ncompatibility to all previous versions. This means that tools that process\nthis version of the specification can also process earlier versions of\nEDK II INF files.\nThis version of the specification removes content in this section that was\nassociated with EDK libraries and components. The section now lists only the\ndefined EDK II symbols and format.\n\nNote: Possible values for MODULE_TYPE, and their descriptions, are\nlisted in the table, \"EDK II Module Types.\" For each module, the BASE_NAME\nand MODULE_TYPE are required. The BASE_NAME definition is case\nsensitive as it will be used to create a directory name during a build.\n\nUnlike EDK, only the [Defines] section tag is valid for EDK II INF files -\narchitectural modifiers for the [Defines] section tag are not permitted. The\nsection is processed in order by the parsing utilities. Assignments of\nvariables in other sections override previous assignments.\nThe SHADOW keyword is only valid for SEC, PEI_CORE and PEIM module\ntypes. It is an error to declare the SHADOW keyword in other module types.\nThe default value of SHADOW is \"FALSE\" when the SHADOW keyword is not\nspecified.\nEDK II modules that provide different library class implementations must use\nmultiple LIBRARY_CLASS statements. Each LIBRARY_CLASS statement must provide\nthe name of the library class supported, followed by the pipe \"|\" field\nseparator and then a space \" \" delimited list of module types the library\ninstances supports. The following is an example of specifying multiple library\nclasses.\nLIBRARY_CLASS = FOO | PEI_CORE PEIM\nLIBRARY_CLASS = BAR | DXE_CORE DXE_DRIVER DXE_SMM_DRIVER\n\n\nNote: Each library class requires a header file defined in the package that\ndeclares the library class. Refer to the \"EDK II Module Writer's Guide\" for\nmore information about writing drivers and libraries.\n\nAdditionally, a driver module may expose internal implementations of a library\nclass, making the internal implementations public. As an example, a DXE_CORE\nimplementation that uses internal functions that provide the functionality of\nthe EDK II Base Memory Library. The DXE_CORE module that provides these\nfunctions (for example, DxeMain.inf) can expose them for use by other DXE\ndrivers that depend on the BaseMemoryLib library class.\nThe OptionRom statements must be included for UEFI PCI Option ROMs, and can\nonly be used with a MODULE_TYPE of UEFI_DRIVER.\nThe optional MODULE_UNI_FILE entry is used to locate an Unicode file which\ncan be used for localization of the module's Abstract and Description from the\nheader section. The content of the file can be generated by tools during the\ninstallation of a distribution package that conforms to the UEFI Platform\nInitialization Distribution Packaging Specification, or by module developers\ncreating new content.\nThe FixedComments sections that follow a defines section are to permit tools\nto work with UEFI Distribution Packaging Specification requirements.\nPrototype\n\nNote: The entry, INF_VERSION, BASE_NAME, FILE_GUID and MODULE_TYPE\nare required for EDK II Modules. The VERSION_STRING entry is highly\nrecommended.\n\n          ::= \"[Defines]\" \n                       +\n ::=  \"INF_VERSION\"   \n                        \"BASE_NAME\"   \n                        \"FILE_GUID\"   \n                        \"MODULE_TYPE\"   \n                       [ \"UEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION\" \n                        ]\n                       [ \"PI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION\" \n                        ]\n                       [ \"LIBRARY_CLASS\"   ]*\n                       [ \"BUILD_NUMBER\"   ]\n                       [ \"VERSION_STRING\" \n                        ]\n                       [ \"PCD_IS_DRIVER\" \n                        ]\n                       [ \"ENTRY_POINT\"   [] ]*\n                       [ \"UNLOAD_IMAGE\"  \n                       [] ]*\n                       [ \"CONSTRUCTOR\"   [] ]*\n                       [ \"DESTRUCTOR\"   [] ]*\n                       [ \"SHADOW\"   ]\n                       []\n                       [ \"CUSTOM_MAKEFILE\" \n                        ]*\n                       [ \"DPX_SOURCE\"   ]\n                       [ \"SPEC\"   ]*\n                       [  ]\n                       [ \"MODULE_UNI_FILE\"   ]\n                       []*\n         ::= (a-zA-Z0-9)(a-zA-Z0-9_-.)*\n  ::= \"UEFI_HII_RESOURCE_SECTION\"  \n       ::= [ ] \n    ::= {\"PEI_PCD_DRIVER\"} {\"DXE_PCD_DRIVER\"}\n             ::=   \n         ::= {} {\"NULL\"}\n      ::=  [ ]\n      ::=  [ ]*\n              ::=  \n      ::= {} {(0-9))+ \".\" (0-9)+}\n    ::=  \"PCI_VENDOR_ID\"   \n                        \"PCI_DEVICE_ID\"   \n                        \"PCI_CLASS_CODE\"   \n                        \"PCI_REVISION\"   \n                       [ \"PCI_COMPRESS\"   ]\n           ::= {\"TRUE\"} {\"FALSE\"}\n\nParameters\nFilename\nFilenames listed in the [Defines] section must be relative to the directory\nthe INF file is in. Use of \"..\", \".\" and \"../\" in the directory path is not\npermitted. Use of an absolute path is not permitted. The file name specified in\nthe MODULE_UNI_FILE entry must be a Unicode file with an extension of .uni,\n.UNI or .Uni.\nMODULE_TYPE\nDrivers and applications are not allowed to have a MODULE_TYPE of \"BASE\".\nOnly libraries are permitted to a have a MODULE_TYPE of \"BASE\". A INF file\ncan be used to specify other binary files types, such as logo images or\nlegacy16 option ROMs. The USER_DEFINED module type must be used in all cases\nwhere the module type is not a member of .\nINF_VERSION\nFor new INF files, the version value must be set to 0x00010019. Tools that\nprocess this version of the INF file can successfully process earlier versions\nof the INF file (this is a backward compatible update). There is no requirement\nto change the value in existing INF files if no other content changes. This may\nalso be specified as decimal value, 1.25.\nEDK_RELEASE_VERSION\nThis optional value may be set to the major/minor number of the EDK II release\nrequired for modules to function correctly.\nUEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION\nThe UEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION must only be set in the INF file if the module\ndepends on UEFI Boot Services or UEFI Runtime Services or UEFI System Table\nfields or UEFI core behaviors that are not present in the UEFI 2.1 version. The\nversion number for the UEFI 2.3.1 specification is the hex value: 0x0002001F.\nThe minor number of the specification version is a 2 digit number, where the\n2.3.1 is actually: 2.31 The major number must be incremented on a revision that\nwould result in a minor number greater than 99.\nPI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION\nThe PI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION must only be set in the INF file if the module\ndepends on services or system table fields or PI core behaviors that are not\npresent in the PI 1.0 version. The version number for the 1.2 PI specification\nis the hex value: 0x00010014 The minor number of the specification version is a\n2 digit number, where the 1.2 is actually: 1.20 The major number must be\nincremented on a revision that would result in a minor number greater than 99.\nVERSION_STRING\nThis is typically a decimal number, and if not specified, an empty string will\nbe provided. This value will be converted by the build tools from an ASCII\nstring into a null-terminated Unicode string that contains a text\nrepresentation of the version. A platform integrator may specify a different\nversion string for an FFS version section in the FDF file if more than just\nthis value is needed. It is recommended that the decimal number be used in such\na manner as the integer portion of the value is considered the major number\n(changing when there is a functional, non-backward compatible change). The\nfactional portion of the value is the considered the minor number (changing\nanytime there is a change in the code that would result in a binary image that\nwas not identical to the binary image created prior to the change).\nBuildNumber\nThe optional build number must be NumValUint16 If not present, the EDK II build\ntools will use the BUILD_NUMBER from the DSC file. If the DSC file does not\ninclude the build number, the EDK II build tools will use a value of 0 If the\nBuild number is greater than 0, the generated INF file must contain this\nentry.\nSpec\nThe user is required to ensure that a valid C name is used for the name of the\nspecification, and provide the decimal version of the specification. For\nexample, SPEC USB_SPECIFICATION_VERSION = 2.0 is a valid statement. These\nstatements are used to generate #define statements in the auto generated C files.\nUefiHiiResource\nThis is an optional tag used to identify UEFI compliant drivers that must have\na UEFI_HII_RESOURCE_SECTION generated as part of the efi image file. If not\nspecified, the default is false.\nDPX_SOURCE\nThe path and filename must be relative to the INF file and located within the\nmodule's directory tree. The file must contain only DEPEX statements as defined\nin the UEFI PI Specification that are valid for the module type. C style\nComments are not in the file. Contents of this file completely override any\ndependency expressions listed in [Depex] sections and all inherited\ndependency expressions that would normally have been inherited from libraries\nlinked to the module. Use of this feature is not recommended for normal use.\nOptionRomInfo\nThese statements are used by developers of stand-alone PCI Option ROM drivers.\nThey allow the developer to forego creation of an FDF file in the package\ndirectory. Only the INF file and a DSC file are required for pure PCI Option\nROM development.\nENTRY_POINT CName\nThis is the name of the driver's entry point function. Refer to the UEFI Driver\nWriter's Guide for more information.\nUNLOAD_IMAGE CName\nIf a driver chooses to be unloadable, then this is the name of the module's\nfunction registered in the Loaded Image Protocol. It is called if the UEFI Boot\nService UnloadImage() is called for the module, which then executes the Unload\nfunction, disconnecting itself from handles in the database as well as\nuninstalling any protocols that were installed in the driver entry point. The\nCName is the name of this module's unload function. Refer to the UEFI Driver\nWriter's Guide for more information.\nExample (EDK II Driver)\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION                = 1.25\n  BASE_NAME                  = PlatformAcpiTable\n  FILE_GUID                  = 7E374E25-8E01-4FEE-87F2-390C23C606CD\n  MODULE_TYPE                = DXE_DRIVER\n  VERSION_STRING             = 1.0\n  EDK_RELEASE_VERSION        = 0x00020000\n  UEFI_SPECIFICATION_VERSION = 0x00020014\n\nExample (UEFI Driver)\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION    = 0x00010019\n  BASE_NAME      = Abc\n  FILE_GUID      = DA87D340-15C0-4824-9BF3-D52286674BEF\n  MODULE_TYPE    = UEFI_DRIVER\n  VERSION_STRING = 1.0\n  ENTRY_POINT    = AbcDriverEntryPoint\n  UNLOAD_IMAGE   = AbcUnload\n\nExample (EDK II Library)\n[Defines]\n  INF_VERSION    = 1.25\n  BASE_NAME      = LzmaCustomDecompressLib\n  FILE_GUID      = 22f8406f-43ee-492f-82f5-4e8a1a58e6d2\n  MODULE_TYPE    = BASE\n  VERSION_STRING = 1.0\n  LIBRARY_CLASS  = CustomDecompressLib\n\n"},"3_edk_ii_inf_file_format/35_[buildoptions]_sections.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_inf_file_format/35_[buildoptions]_sections.html","title":"3.5 [BuildOptions] Sections","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

These sections are used to define\nthe custom definitions for individual tools. There are two styles for options,\na replacement of any previous definition (for this module only) of the flags or\ncommands used (specified by the double \"==\" equal sign) to process the module\ncode, or an append option, (specified by the single \"=\" equal sign) which\nwill be appended to the previous definition. When the single \"=\" equal sign\nis used, the string to the left, is appended, typically used to override a\nsingle flag. When the double \"==\" sign is used, then any previous definition\n(reference build requires that it must be defined tools_def.txt file) will be\ncleared, and the left value replaces the entire previous definition.\nThe double \"==\" equal sign must be used to replace a command (specified by\nthe PATH attribute,) appending is not an option.\nFor the DPATH attribute, can use either the replace or append, and is used to\nexpand the system environment PATH variable prior to processing any commands.\nOther, user defined attributes, can be specified, in this section, using either\nthe append or replace. Usage of these overrides is implementation specific.\nMacro use is permitted in the [BuildOptions] sections, and must follow the\nrule that Macros used in this section must be defined locally within the INF\nfile; use of externally defined MACROs is prohibited. Additionally, a\n$(MACRO) that appears inside of a quoted string in R-Values (following an\nappend \"=\" or replace \"==\") is permitted, as parsing tools are not required\nto expand those macro values. Macros within quoted strings do not need to be\ndefined locally.\nMacro statements, $(MACRO), that are encapsulated in double quotation marks\nare not expanded, nor are they processed by parsing tools, as double quotation\nmarks indicate a string that must be treated as a single entity. Macro\nstatements in comments must also be ignored by parsing tools.\nMacros are not allowed on the left side of the assignment statement (left of\nthe equal sign).\nThe EDK II build system will provide an option to create an \"As Built\" INF file\nthat can be used for binary distributions. This section will be completed,\nlisting all of the option flags for every application that was used to create\nthe binary. Since these \"As Built\" flags are within comment sections, the\nactual flag string can be extended to a new comment line without using the line\nextension character.\nTools that create \"As Built\" information must expand any macro values used by\nthe tools during the module build. The standard Macro Definitions are not\npermitted within this section for an \"As Built\" INF file.\nBuild options listed in architectural sections will be appended to build\noptions listed in the common architectural section.\nComments in this section must appear on a separate line, they may not be\nappended after statements.\nThe \"common\" architecture modifier in a section tag must not be combined with\nother architecture type; doing so will result in a build break.\nPrototype\n  ::= \"[BuildOptions\" [] \"]\"  \n     ::= {\".common\"} {}\n         ::=  [\",\"  \"BuildOptions\" ]*\n         ::= \".\" \n    ::= {*} {}\n  ::=  \"##\"  \"@AsBuilt\"  *\n    ::=  \"##\"      [ \"#\"\n                     ]*\n   ::= \n ::= {} {} {} {}\n         ::=  \":\"\n      ::=  []    \n      ::=  []    \n       ::=  []    \n         ::= {} {}\n     ::=  []    \n        ::= {\"MSFT\"} {\"GCC\"} {\"INTEL\"} {} {}\n           ::= \n         ::= {} {}\n      ::= \n     ::=  \"==\" \n      ::=  \"_\"  \"_\"  \"_\" \n     ::=  \"_FLAGS\"\n      ::=  \"_DPATH\"\n       ::=  \"_PATH\"\n     ::=  \"_\" \n        ::= {} {Target}\n       ::= {} {TagName}\n       ::= CommandCode\n   ::= CommandExecutable\n     ::= Attribute\n         ::= {\"IA32\"} {\"X64\"} {\"IPF\"} {\"EBC\"} {}\n                    {}\n        ::= (0x20 - 0x7e)+\n       ::=   \n      ::= {} { }\n      ::= {(a-zA-Z) \":\\\"} {\"\\\"} {\"/\"}\n\nParameters\nAll of the keywords that make up the left side of the expression must be\nalphanumeric only - no special characters are permitted. For more information\nabout the following parameters, refer to the Build Specification for as\ndescription of the tools_def.txt file. In order for the entries in the INF\nfile to be valid, there must be a matching definition in the tools_def.txt\nfile. The tool chain tag name must also match the one used for the build.\nFamily\nMust match a FAMILY name defined in the EDK II tools_def.txt file. If not\npresent, then the entry is valid for all tool chain families.\nTOOLPATH\nPaths listed in the [BuildOptions] section are relative to the system\nenvironment variable, EDK_TOOLS_PATH, or they may be absolute. Use of \"..\",\n\".\" and \"../\" in the directory path is not permitted. If the absolute format is\nused, the module cannot be distributed using a UEFI Distribution Package.\nTarget\nA keyword that uniquely identifies the build target; the first field, where\nfields are separated by the underscore character. Three values, \"NOOPT\",\n\"DEBUG\" and \"RELEASE\" have been pre-defined. This keyword is used to bind\ncommand flags to individual commands.\nUsers may want to add other definitions, such as, PERF, SIZE or SPEED, and\ndefine their own set of FLAGS to use with these tags. The wildcard character,\n\"``*\", is permitted after it has been defined one time for a tool chain.\nTagName\nA keyword that uniquely identifies a tool chain group; the second field.\nWildcard characters are permitted if and only if a command is common to all\ntools that will be used by a developer. As an example, if the development team\nonly uses IA32 Windows workstations, the ACPI compiler can be specified as:\nDEBUG_*_*_ASL_PATH and RELEASE_*_*_ASL_PATH.\nArch\nA keyword that uniquely identifies the tool chain target architecture; the\nthird field. This flag is used to support the cross-compiler features, such as\nwhen a development platform is IA32 and the target platform is X64 Using this\nfield, a single TagName can be setup to support building multiple target\nplatform architectures with different tool chains. As an example, if a\ndeveloper is using Visual Studio .NET 2003 for generating IA32 platform and\nuses the WINDDK version 3790.1830 for X64 or IPF platform images, a single tag\n(see the MYTOOLS PATH settings in the generated Conf/tools_def.txt or\nprovided BaseTools/Conf/tools_def.template file.) The wildcard character,\n\"``*\", is permitted if and only if the same tool is used for all target\narchitectures.\nCommandExecutable\nThe full executable name, such as cl.exe or gcc, with the preceding path\nspecifying the exact location of the command. If the executable can be located\nunder a directory specified in the system environment PATH variable, only the\nfilename is required. Otherwise, a relative path to a path listed in the system\nenvironment PATH variable or an absolute path must be given. If an absolute\npath is used, the build system will fail the build if the executable cannot be\nfound.\nCommandCode\nA keyword that uniquely identifies a specific command; the fourth field.\nSeveral CommandCode keywords have been predefined. See table below for the\npre-defined keywords and functional mappings. The wildcard character, \"\", is\npermitted only for the FAMILY, DLL and DPATH attributes (see\n*Attributes below.)\nTable 5 Predefined Command Codes\n\n\n\nCommandCode\nFunction\n\n\n\n\nAPP\nC compiler for applications.\n\n\nASL\nACPI Compiler for generating ACPI tables.\n\n\nASLCC\nACPI Table C compiler\n\n\nASLDLINK\nACPI Table C Dynamic linker\n\n\nASLPP\nASL C pre-processor\n\n\nASM\nA Macro Assembler for assembly code in some libraries.\n\n\nASMLINK\nThe Linker to use for assembly code generated by the ASM tool.\n\n\nCC\nC compiler for PE32/PE32+/Coff images.\n\n\nDLINK\nThe C dynamic linker.\n\n\nMAKE\nRequired for tool chains. This identifies the utility used to process the Makefiles generated by the first phase of the build.\n\n\nPCH\nThe compiler for generating pre-compiled headers.\n\n\nPP\nThe C pre-processor command.\n\n\nSLINK\nThe C static linker.\n\n\nTIANO\nThis special keyword identifies a compression tool used to generate compression sections as well as the library needed to uncompress an image in the firmware volume.\n\n\nVFR\nThe VFR file compiler which creates IFR code.\n\n\nVFRPP\nThe C pre-processor used to process VFR files.\n\n\n\nAttribute\nA keyword to uniquely identify a property of the command; the fifth and last\nfield. Several pre-defined attributes have been defined: DLL, FAMILY,\nFLAGS, GUID, OUTPUT and PATH. Use quotation marks if and only if the\nquotation marks must be included in the flag string. The following example shows\nthe format for the required quoted string,\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Intel\\EBC\\Lib\\EbcLib.lib\". Normally, the quotation\ncharacters are not required as everything following the equal sign to the end of\nthe line is used for the flag.\nFlags\nMust be a valid string for the tool specified. The string will be appended to\nthe end of the tool's flags (from the tools_def.txt.) Both Microsoft and GCC\nevaluate options from left to right on the command line. This allows disabling\nsome flags that may have been specified in the tools_def.txt by providing an\nalternate flag, i.e., if the tools_def: CC FLAGS defines /O2 and an /O1 options\nis specified for this module, the module will compile with /O1 (size) not with\n/O2 (speed.)\nSpace characters are allowed. Macros are also permitted to be used in Flag\nstrings.\nExample\n[BuildOptions.common]\n  DEFINE MACRO                  = /nologo\n  *_WINDDK3790x1830_*_CC_FLAGS  = /Qwd1418,810\n  *_MYTOOLS_*_CC_FLAGS          = /Qwd1418,810\n  *_VS2003_*_CC_FLAGS           = /wd4244\n  *_WINDDK3790x1830_*_CC_FLAGS  = /wd4244\n  *_MYTOOLS_*_CC_FLAGS          = /wd4244\n  RELEASE_MYTOOLS_IPF_ASM_FLAGS = = -N us -X explicit -M ilp64 - N so -W3 MSFT:*_*_*_*_FLAGS = /od $(MACRO)\n\n"},"3_edk_ii_inf_file_format/36_[libraryclasses]_sections.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_inf_file_format/36_[libraryclasses]_sections.html","title":"3.6 [LibraryClasses] Sections","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The Library Class\nentries are single lines with one or two fields, separated by the pipe \"|\"\ncharacter.\nThe EDK II build system will provide an option to generate an \"As Built\" INF\nthat can be used to distribution binary modules. Since a binary distribution\ndoes not build, the library instances that were linked into the binary are\nlisted in comments, rather than as library class keywords and recommended\ninstances. Tools that create \"As Built\" information must expand any macro\nvalues used by the tools during the module build.

The [Depex]\nsection is a replacement for the dependency file specified by the driver\nwriter. The DPX_SOURCE in the [Defines] section an EDK INF file will\nover-ride the dependency specified here. This section can be used for\ninheritance from libraries, by supporting logical AND'ing of the different\nDepex expressions together.\nThe Rules would be as follows:\n\nEDK II INF - [Depex] section and inheritance from libraries is supported\nvia AND'ing the different Depex expressions together\n\nEDK II INF - The [Defines] section's keyword, DPX_SOURCE, would override\nDepex section and let module owner force a Depex independent of the [Depex]\ninheritance. Not recommended, but gives complete control to the driver writer.\n\nEach [Depex] section tag listed in an INF file must be unique. If there are\nmultiple [Depex] sections that have the same section tag, i.e.,\n[Depex.IA32.DXE_DRIVER] and another [Depex.IA32.DXE_DRIVER] section in the\nsame INF, the build must break.\n\n\nIf a DPX_SOURCE is specified in the [Defines] section, the [Depex]\nsection is ignored, and the file specified in the DPX_SOURCE is used instead.\nWhen processing the file, the INF file name specified in the  and\n statement is replaced by the FILE_GUID value from the INF\nfile, translated to a POSIX C structure as shown below:\nINTERFACENAME = { /* 0F05DE03-8A1B-408C-8F84-B547F593E463 */\n    0x0F05DE03,\n    0x8A1B,\n    0x408C,\n    {0x8F, 0x84, 0xB5, 0x47, 0xF5, 0x93, 0xE4, 0x63}\n  };\n\nThe term, \"SOR\" is ignored as part of the dependency processing. The DXE\ndriver is to remain on the Schedule on Request (SOR) queue until the DXE\nService Schedule() is called for this DXE. The dependency expression\nevaluator treats this operation like a No Operation (NOP).\nThere are three types of dependency sections (PEI, SMM and DXE) permitted by\nspecifications. The SMM dependency section uses the same grammar as the DXE\ndependency section. The optional tags (identified as  in the EBNF,\nbelow) must be used at the start of a depex listing. The depex expression for a\ngiven type is terminated by the start of a new optional section tag, the start\nof a new section or the end of file.\nDrivers with MODULE_TYPE set to SEC, PEI_CORE, DXE_CORE, SMM_CORE,\nUEFI_DRIVER and UEFI_APPLICATION cannot have [Depex] sections. Libraries\nand modules that are USER_DEFINED may have a [Depex] section. All remaining\ndrivers, PEIM, DXE_DRIVER, DXE_SAL_DRIVER, DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER and\nDXE_SMM_DRIVER module types must have a [Depex] section.\nLibraries of type SEC, PEI_CORE, DXE_CORE, SMM_CORE and\nUEFI_APPLICATION are not allowed to have a [Depex]. The MODULE_TYPE entry\nin the [Defines] section for a library only defines the module type that the\nbuild system must assume for building the library. It does not define the types\nof modules that a library may be linked with. Instead, the LIBRARY_CLASS\nentry in the [Defines] section optionally lists the supported module types\nthat the library may be linked against.\nLibraries of type BASE are not permitted to have generic (i.e., [Depex]) and\ngeneric with only architectural modifier (i.e., [Depex.IA32]) entries. Library\nof type BASE are permitted to have a Depex section if one ModuleType modifier\nis specified (i.e., [Depex.common.PEIM).\nWhen using the ModuleType as a section modifier (for example:\n[Depex.IA32.PEIM]), for drivers, the ModuleType must match the value of\nMODULE_TYPE entry in the [Defines] section. For Libraries, the ModuleType\nused in the section modifier must be a member of the Module Types listed after\nthe LIBRARY_CLASS keyword in the [Defines] section. If no module types are\nlisted after the LIBRARY_CLASS keyword in the [Defines] section, then the\nlibrary is compatible with all module types, so all module types may be used as\na section modifier.\nThe \"common\" architecture modifier in a section tag must not be combined with\nother architecture type; doing so will result in a build break.\nIf the MODULE_TYPE is UserDefined, the build tools must exit gracefully and\nprovide the user with an error message stating that the [Depex] section\nheader does not provide enough information to determine the type of the Depex\nsection.\nIf the module is not a library (no LIBRARY_CLASS in the [Defines] section)\nand the MODULE_TYPE is SEC, SMM_CORE, DXE_CORE, PEI_CORE,\nUEFI_DRIVER or UEFI_APPLICATION a Depex section is not permitted.

Files listed in\narchitectural sections are not permitted to be listed in the common\narchitectural section.\nThe \"common\" architecture modifier in a section tag must not be combined with\nother architecture type; doing so will result in a build break.\nThere can be multiple [Binaries] sections, depending on the target processor.\nExample binaries sections are listed below. Each binary file's path is relative\nto the location of the component's INF file. The parsing utility creates a\ndirectory path for each file ($(DEST_DIR)/Path/OUTPUT), and copies each file\n(or a processed version of a Unicode User Interface or Version section) to the\nOUTPUT directory. No makefile is produced, as binary files are only used by\nthe third phase of a build, creating FV, FD or similar binary files.\nAll file names specified in this section must be in the directory containing\nthe INF file or in sub-directories of the directory containing the INF file.\nWhen a binary INF file is generated by tools during a source build, if a symbol\nfile, such as a PDB or SYM file is generated, the tools must add the file to\nthis section using a binary file type of \"DISPOSABLE\".\nOne and only one EFI_SECTION_VERSION is allowed in a FFS image, therefore one\nand only one VER (VER or UNI_VER) can be included in any one [Binaries]\nsection.\nOne and only one EFI_SECTION_USER_INTERFACE is allowed in a FFS image,\ntherefore one and only one UI (UI or UNI_UI) can be included in any one\n[Binaries] section.\nOne and only one EFI_SECTION_FREEFORM_SUBTYPE_GUID is allowed in a FFS image,\ntherefore one and only one SUBTYPE_GUID with a unique GUID Value can be\nincluded in any one [Binaries] section.\nPrototype\n           ::= \"[Binaries\" [] \"]\" \n                         []\n                         []\n                         *\n ::= {} {} {}\n        ::= {\".common\"} {}\n            ::=  [\",\"  \"Binaries\" ]*\n              ::= \".\" \n       ::=   [] \n          ::=  [] [ ]\n             ::=   \n             ::= {\"UNI_UI\"} {\"UI\"}\n      ::=   [] \n         ::=  [] [ ]\n            ::=   \n            ::= {\"UNI_VER\"} {\"VER\"}\n        ::=  \"SUBTYPE_GUID\"  \n           ::=    \n          ::= {} {}\n        ::=    \n           ::=   [] \n            ::=  [] []\n               ::=  [] []\n               ::=  [] []\n               ::=  \n             ::= {} {}\n             ::= {\"MSFT\"} {\"GCC\"} {\"INTEL\"} {}\n                         {}\n                ::= \n            ::= {ToolWord} {}\n ::= \n           ::= \n       ::= {\"ACPI\"} {\"ASL\"} {\"PE32\"} {\"PIC\"} {\"FV\"}\n                         {\"PEI_DEPEX\"} {\"DXE_DEPEX\"} {\"SMM_DEPEX\"}\n                         {\"TE\"} {\"BIN\"} {\"RAW\"} {\"COMPAT16\"}\n                         {\"DISPOSABLE\"} {\"LIB\"}\n\nParameters\nFeatureFlagExpress\nWhen present, the feature flag expression determines whether the entry line is\nvalid. If the feature flag expression evaluates to FALSE, this entry will be\nignored by the EDK II build tools.\n\nNote: For more information about the following parameters, refer to the\nBuild Specification for a description of the tools_def.txt file. In order for\nthe entries in the INF file to be valid, there must be a matching definition\nin the tools_def.txt file. The tool chain tag name must also match the one\nused for the build.\n\nTarget\nA keyword that uniquely identifies the build target. This keyword is used to\nbind command flags to individual commands. Refer to the Build Specification for\nthe exact format of the tools_def.txt file. The tools_def.txt file defines\na label to specify different items such as executables, options and locations.\nThe label is broken up into fields which are separated by an underscore\ncharacter. The Target must be either a wildcard character (meaning all targets)\nor it must be specified in the first field of at least one of these labels.\nThree values, \"NOOPT\", \"DEBUG\" and \"RELEASE\", have been pre-defined.\nUsers may want to add other definitions, such as, PERF, SIZE or SPEED, and\ndefine their own set of FLAGS to use with these tags.\nTagName\nTagNames must also appear in at least one Label specified in the\ntools_def.txt file. The TagName must be either a wildcard character\n(meaning any TagName) or it must match a defined value for a TagName label in\nthe tools_def.txt file for the tool chain tag name specified.\nFamily\nFamily is keyword that uniquely identifies a tool chain family. The Family\nmust be either a wildcard character (meaning any Family) or it must match a\ndefined value for a Family label in the tools_def.txt file for at least one\ntool chain TagName specified in tools_def.txt (or the TagName field that\nfollows this field in the entry).\nFileType: \"SUBTYPE_GUID\"\nThe file type, \"SUBTYPE_GUID\" is shorthand for the\nEFI_FREEFORM_SUBTYPE_GUID_SECTION section.\nFileType: \"DISPOSABLE\"\nThe file type, \"DISPOSABLE\" does not represent content for the\nEFI_SECTION_DISPOSABLE. These files will not be processed by EDK II build\ntools, but rather, may specify other types of files that may be used such as\nPDB or SYMS files generated for symbolic debugging.\nExample\n[Binaries.common]\n  UNI_UI|DxeIpl.ui\n  UNI_VER|DxeLoad.ver\n\n[Binaries.Ia32]\n  DXE_DEPEX|Release/DxeIpl.dpx            # MYTOOLS\n  PE32|Debug/Ia32/DxeIpl.efi|DEBUG        # MYTOOLS\n  PE32|Release/Ia32/DxeIpl.efi|RELEASE    # MYTOOLS\n  DISPOSABLE|Debug/Ia32/DxeIpl.pdb|DEBUG\n\n[Binaries.X64]\n  DXE_DEPEX|Debug/X64/DxeIpl.dpx          # MYTOOLS\n  PE32|Debug/X64/DxeIpl.efi|DEBUG         # MYTOOLS\n  DISPOSABLE|Debug/X64/DxeIpl.pdb|DEBUG\n\n[Binaries.IPF]\n  DXE_DEPEX|Debug/IPF/DxeIpl.dpx          # MYTOOLS\n  PE32|Debug/Ipf/DxeIpl.efi|DEBUG         # MYTOOLS\n  DISPOSABLE|Debug/Ipf/DxeIpl.pdb|DEBUG\n\n"},"appendix_a_edk_inf_file_specification/":{"url":"appendix_a_edk_inf_file_specification/","title":"Appendix A EDK INF File Specification","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The EDK parsing utilities\nprocess local symbol assignments made in this section. Note that the sections\nare processed in the order listed here, and later assignments of these local\nsymbols do not override previous assignments.\nThis section will typically use one of the following section definitions:\n[define]\n[defines]\n[defines.IA32]\n[defines.X64]\n[defines.IPF]\n[defines.EBC]\n\n\nNote: The [define] section tag is only valid for EDK INF files.

They are responsible for preparing the platform for the PEI Phase. Since there are no standard services defined for SEC, modules of this type follow the same rules as modules of type Base and typically include some amount of CPU specific assembly code to establish temporary memory for a stack. Modules of this type may optionally produce services that are passed to the PEI Phase in HOBs and those services must be compliant with the PEI CIS.\n\n\nPEI_CORE\n.efi\n.PEI\nThis module type is used by PEI Core implementations that are complaint with the PEI CIS.\n\n\nCOMBINED_PEIM_DRIVER\n.efi\n.PEI\n\n\n\nPIC_PEIM\n.efi\n.PEI\n\n\n\nRELOCATABLE_PEIM\n.efi\n.PEI\nWhen migrating to EDK II, this type of module should use the register for shadow PPI, and set the [defines] entry: SHADOW = TRUE\n\n\nPE32_PEIM\n.efi\n.PEI\nThis module type is used by PEIMs that are compliant with the PEI CIS\n\n\nBS_DRIVER\n.efi\n.DXE\nThis module type is either the DXE Core or DXE Drivers that are complaint with the DXE CIS. These modules only execute in the boot services environment and are destroyed when ExitBootServices() is called.\n\n\nRT_DRIVER\n.efi\n.DXE\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are complaint with the DXE CIS. These modules execute in both boot services and runtime services environments. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices() is called. If SetVirtualAddressMap() is called, then modules of this type are relocated according to virtual address map provided by the operating system.\n\n\nSAL_RT_DRIVER\n.efi\n.DXE\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that can be called in physical mode before SetVirtualAddressMap() is called and either physical mode or virtual mode after SetVirtualAddressMap() is called. This module type is only available to IPF CPUs. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices().\n\n\nBS_DRIVER\n.efi\n.SMM\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are loaded into SMRAM. As a result, this module type is only available for IA-32 and x64 CPUs. These modules only execute in physical mode, and are never destroyed. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices().\n\n\nAPPLICATION\n.efi\n.APP\nThis module type is used by UEFI Applications that are compliant with the EFI 1.10 Specification or the UEFI 2.0 Specification. UEFI Applications are always unloaded when they exit.\n\n\nEFI USER INTERFACE\n.ui\n.ui\n\n\n\nEFI VERSION\n.ver\n.ver\n\n\n\nEFI DEPENDENCY\n.dpx\n.dpx\n\n\n\nA.1.2 [sources] Section\nThe [sources] section is used to specify the files that make up the\ncomponent. Directories names are required for files existing in subdirectories\nof the component. All directory names are relative to the location of the INF\nfile. Macros are allowed in the source file path. For EDK builds, each file is\nadded to the macro of $(INC_DEPS), which can be used in a makefile dependency\nexpression.\nThis section will typically use one of the following section definitions:\n[sources]\n[sources.common]\n[sources.IA32]\n[sources.X64]\n[sources.IPF]\n[sources.EBC]\n\nThe following example demonstrates entries in this section.\n[sources.common]\n  DxeIpl.dxs\n  DxeIpl.h\n  DxeLoad.c\n\n[sources.Ia32]\n  Ia32/VirtualMemory.h\n  Ia32/VirtualMemory.c\n  Ia32/DxeLoadFunc.c\n  Ia32/ImageRead.c\n\n[sources.X64]\n  X64/DxeLoadFunc.c\n\n[sources.IPF]\n  Ipf/DxeLoadFunc.c\n  Ipf/ImageRead.c\n\nBinary file types - EDK does not have the flexibility of EDK II, but does\nprovide a method for specifying binary files in the [sources] section.

The library names do not\ninclude the directory locations or the extension name of the file. For each\nlibrary, {LibName}, found, the {LibName} is added to the LIBS definition in\nthe output makefile:\nLIBS = $(LIBS) $(LIB_DIR)\\{LibName}\nThis section will typically use one of the following section definitions:\n[libraries.common]\n[libraries.IA32]\n[libraries.X64]\n[libraries.IPF]\n[libraries.EBC]\n\nThe formats for entries in this section is:\nLibraryName\nThe following is an example of a libraries section.\n[libraries.common]\n  EfiProtocolLib\n  EfiDriverLib\n\nA.1.4 [includes] Section\nThe [includes] section of the EDK INF file is a list of directories to be\nincluded on the compile command line. These are included in a section of the\nMakefile generated by the parsing utilities. For each include path specified,\nthe following line is written to the component's makefile.\nINC = $(INC) -I $(SOURCE_DIR)\\{path}\nThe path must be absolute, however the use of the global variable, EDK_SOURCE\nis recommended to construct the path.\nThis section will typically use one of the following section definitions:\n[includes.common]\n[includes.IA32]\n[includes.X64]\n[includes.IPF]\n[includes.Nt32]\n[include.common]\n[include.IA32]\n[include.X64]\n[include.IPF]\n\nThe formats for entries in this section is:\n$(EDK_SOURCE)/path/to/header/files\nThe following is an example of the [includes] section.\n[includes.common]\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationEfi\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)Foundation\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationFramework\n  .\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationInclude\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationEfiInclude\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationFrameworkInclude\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationIncludeIndustryStandard\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationCoreDxe\n  $(EDK_SOURCE)FoundationLibraryDxeInclude\n\nA.1.5 [nmake] Section\nThe optional EDK [nmake] section may also include a \".ProcessorName\" to\nrestrict processing based on the processor name. The section data is simply\ncopied directly to the component makefile, before the build commands are\nemitted.\nThis section will typically use one of the following section definitions:\n[nmake]\n[nmake.common]\n[nmake.IA32]\n[nmake.X64]\n[nmake.IPF]\n[nmake.EBC]\n\nThe format for entries in this section is any valid Makefile syntax.

Some items are\nemitted to the output makefile.\nThe FILE_GUID is required for all EDK components that are not libraries. This\nguid is used to build the FW volume file list used by build tools to generate\nthe final firmware volume, as well as processed in some SMM, PEI or DXE DEPEX\nstatements.\n\nNote: Possible values for COMPONENT_TYPE, and their descriptions, are\nlisted in the table, \"Component (module) Types.\" For each component, the\nBASE_NAME and COMPONENT_TYPE are required. The COMPONENT_TYPE definition\nis case sensitive. The default FV extension can be overridden by defining the\nsymbol FV_EXT.\n\nSection [defines.$(PROCESSOR).$(PLATFORM)] is used with EDK components only.\nThe section is processed in order by the parsing utilities.

These include:\n\nCreating a new component INF file that specifies BUILD_TYPE=xxx, and then\ncreating a [build.$(PROCESSOR).xxx] section in the platform DSC file.\n\nCreating a new component INF file and a makefile for the component, and\nspecifying BUILD_TYPE=MAKEFILE in the INF file. Then add a\n[build.$(PROCESSOR).makefile] section to the DSC file that describes how to\n\"build\" the component using the makefile. Typically this will be commands to\ncopy the file to the $(DEST_DIR), and then invoking nmake.\n\nTrivial customizations can be accomplished by adding or modifying the\n[nmake] sections in the component INF file. This may require defining\n$(PLATFORM) in the EDK DSC file, and then adding a new\n[nmake.$(PROCESSOR).$(PLATFORM)] section in the component INF file.\n\nAnother option is to define a variable in the component INF file, passing it\nto the component makefile via the DSC [makefile.common] section, and then\nusing !IFDEF statements in the [build.$(PROCESSOR).$(COMPONENT_TYPE)]\nsection to perform custom steps.\n\n\nB.2 Changing Files in an EDK Library\nLibrary INF files are shared among different platforms. However, not all\nplatforms require all the same source files. To customize the library INF files\nfor different platforms, simply define $(PLATFORM), either on the command\nline, or in the DSC file, and then make customizations in the\n[sources.$(PROCESSOR).$(PLATFORM)] section of the library INF file.\nAn alternative to this method is to simply create a new INF file for the\nlibrary, and then use it in place of the existing library INF file\nB.3 Customizing EDK II Compilation for a Module Common Definitions\nThe preferred method for customizing a build is to copy the source module\ndirectory to a new directory and modifying the INF file and module sources.\nThis method is preferred over the EDK methods as build reproducibility is more\neasily accomplished.\nAdditional customizations for build options should be made in the platform\ndescription (DSC) file. While it is permitted to use the [BuildOptions]\nsection to define custom compiler flags, this section should only be used as a\nlast resort. The default flags defined the tools_def.txt file provide the best\nknown size and speed optimizations, and the platform DSC file can override the\ndefaults in its [BuildOptions] section.\n"},"appendix_c_symbols.html":{"url":"appendix_c_symbols.html","title":"Appendix C Symbols","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Use of\nsymbols follows the makefile convention of enclosing within $(), for example\n$(EDK_SOURCE). As the utility processes files during execution, it will often\nperform parsing of variable assignments. These variables can then be referenced\nin other sections of the DSC file. Variable assignments will be saved internally\nin either a local or global symbol table. The local symbol table is purged\nfollowing processing of individual component INF files. Global symbol values\npersist throughout execution of the utility. Local symbol values take precedent\nover global symbols. The following table describes the symbols generated\ninternally by the utility. They can be overridden either on the command line,\nin the DSC file, or in individual INF files. The G/L column indicates whether\nthe symbol is typically a global or a local symbol.\nTable 8 Symbol Description\n\n\n\nSymbol Name\nG/L\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEDK_SOURCE\nG\nDefines the root directory of the local EDK source tree, for example C:\\EFI2.0 If not defined as an environmental variable when the tool is invoked, the utility will attempt to determine a reasonable value based on the current working directory.\n\n\nEFI_SOURCE\nG\nDefines the root directory of the local EDK source tree, for example C:\\EFI2.0 If not defined as an environmental variable when the tool is invoked, the utility will attempt to determine a reasonable value based on the current working directory.\n\n\nPROCESSOR\nG/L\nDefines the target processor for which the code is to be built. This symbol will typically be used to include or exclude source files in component INF files, and to define the tool chain for building.\n\n\nBUILD_DIR\nG\nDefines the build tip directory for the current platform. For example, this may be $(EDK_SOURCE)\\Platform\\Anacortes_870.\n\n\nSOURCE_DIR\nL\nFor a component, defines the directory of the component source files.\n\n\nDEST_DIR\nL\nFor a component, defines the directory (typically under BUILD_DIR) where the component object files are to be built.\n\n\nLIB_DIR\nL\nSpecifies the directory where EFI libraries are deposited after building. Typically $(BUILD_DIR)\\$(PROCESSOR)\n\n\nBIN_DIR\nL\nSpecifies the directory where final component binaries are deposited during build. Typically $(BUILD_DIR)\\$(PROCESSOR)\n\n\nOUT_DIR\nL\nUnused, but typically $(BUILD_DIR)\\$(PROCESSOR)\n\n\nDSC_FILENAME\nG\nName of the DSC file as specified on the command line. Can be used for dependencies in the makefiles.\n\n\nINF_FILENAME\nL\nName of the INF file for a given component. Can be used for dependencies in the makefiles.\n\n\nFV_EXT\nL\nCommon component type (BS driver, application, etc) have predefined file name extensions assigned (.dxe, .app, etc). If there is a deviation from the convention, or a new\n\n\n\n\n(unknown to the utility) component type is being built, then FV_EXT may need to be defined for the component so the utility knows the result file name extension. This information is necessary to generate dependencies in makefile.out.\n\n\nMAKEFILE_NAME\nL\nName of the output makefile for the component. Default is \"makefile\". This value can be overridden to support building different variations of a component in the same DEST_DIR directory.\n\n\nPLATFORM\nL\nThis symbol can be used to provide more selectivity of files in the component INF files. If assigned, then the utility will also process any files in the INF file under sections [sources.$(PROCESSOR).$(PLATFORM)], [includes.$(PROCESSOR).$(PLATFORM)], and [libraries.$(PROCESSOR).$(PLATFORM)].\n\n\nFILE\nL\nAs the utility processes each source file in the component INF file, this symbol gets assigned the name of the file, less the file extension.\n\n\nPACKAGE\nL/G\nIf defined, then the utility will create a package file named $(DEST_DIR)\\$(BASE_NAME).pkg, and copy, with macro expansion, the [package.$(COMPONENT_TYPE).$(PACKAGE)] section from the DSC file to the output file.\n\n\nPACKAGE_FILE\nL\nIf defined, then the utility will not generate a package file. The build can then use the value $(PACKAGE_FILE) to have GenFfsFile use an existing package file for creating the firmware file.\n\n\n\n"},"appendix_d_sample_driver_inf_files.html":{"url":"appendix_d_sample_driver_inf_files.html","title":"Appendix D Sample Driver INF Files","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The .bmp file should be included under a [binaries] section. In EDK, the COMPONENT_TYPE of LOGO was used to specify a .bmp file in the [sources] section.\n\n\nRAWFILE\nUSER_DEFINED\n.raw\nIn EDK, this was used to specify various types of binary files.\n\n\nFVIMAGEFILE\nN/A\n.fv\n\n\n\nAPRIORI\nNot Supported.\n.bin\nDistribution of an Aprior file is not supported. These files are created during image generation stage based on content of a .FDF file. In EDK, the file was just a text file with a single line for each driver.\n\n\nBASE\nBASE\n.efi\nModules of this type can be ported to any execution environment. This module type is intended to be use by silicon module developers to produce source code that is not tied to any specific execution environment.\n\n\nSEC\nSEC\n.efi\nModules of this type are designed to start execution at the reset vector of a CPU. They are responsible for preparing the platform for the PEI Phase. Since there are no standard services defined for SEC, modules of this type follow the same rules as modules of type Base and typically include some amount of CPU specific assembly code to establish temporary memory for a stack. Modules of this type may optionally produce services that are passed to the PEI Phase in HOBs and those services must be compliant with the PEI CIS.\n\n\nPEI_CORE\nPEI_CORE\n.efi\nThis module type is used by PEI Core implementations that are complaint with the PEI CIS.\n\n\nPEIM\nPEIM\n.efi\nThis module type is used by PEIMs that are compliant with the PEI CIS\n\n\nDXE_CORE\nDXE_CORE\n.efi\nThis module type is used by DXE Core implementations that are compliant with the DXE CIS.\n\n\nDXE_DRIVER\nDXE_DRIVER\n.efi\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are complaint with the DXE CIS. These modules only execute in the boot services environment and are destroyed when ExitBootServices() is called.\n\n\nDXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER\nDXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER\n.efi\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that are complaint with the DXE CIS. These modules execute in both boot services and runtime services environments. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices() is called. If SetVirtualAddressMap() is called, then modules of this type are relocated according to virtual address map provided by the operating system.\n\n\nDXE_SAL_DRIVER\nDXE_SAL_DRIVER\n.efi\nThis module type is used by DXE Drivers that can be called in physical mode before SetVirtualAddressMap() is called and either physical mode or virtual mode after SetVirtualAddressMap() is called. This module type is only available to IPF CPUs. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices().\n\n\nSMM_CORE\nSMM_CORE\n.efi\nThis module is the SMM Core.\n\n\nDXE_SMM_DRIVER\nDXE_SMM_DRIVER\n.efi\nThis module type is used by DXE. Drivers that are loaded into SMRAM. As a result, this module type is only available for IA-32 and x64 CPUs. These modules only execute in physical mode, and are never destroyed. This means the services that these modules produce are available after ExitBootServices().\n\n\nUEFI_DRIVER\nUEFI_DRIVER\n.efi\nThis module type is used by UEFI Drivers that are compliant with the EFI 1.10 Specification or the UEFI 2.x Specification. These modules provide services in the boot services execution environment. UEFI Drivers that return EFI_SUCCESS are not unloaded from memory. UEFI Drivers that return an error are unloaded from memory.\n\n\nUEFI_APPLICATION\nUEFI_APPLICATION\n.efi\nThis module type is used by UEFI Applications that are compliant with the EFI 1.10 Specification or the UEFI 2.x Specification. UEFI Applications are always unloaded when they exit.\n\n\nUSER_DEFINED\nUSER_DEFINED\n.bin or .rom\nUser defined extension\n\n\nEFI Dependency Section\nAny - the code for these sections is included as part of any module, and no separate INF is required.\n.dpx\nThis is the compiled dependency section for SMM, PEIM or DXE modules.
